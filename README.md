# Block Man

The first game ever written with the [Cute Framework (CF)](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_framework). For more details visit the [dev blog here](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=70683.0).

The purpose of this game is mostly to act as an example of how to use CF.

# Building + Running

1. Run `mingw.bat`. For the moment only builds with MinGW on Windows -- but the game code itself has been run on Mac/Linux/Windows/Browsers/Phones. I'm just in the middle of some cmake refactors.
2. Run `block_man.exe` in the `build` folder.
